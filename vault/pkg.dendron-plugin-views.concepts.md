## Browser Mode

In browser mode, we start a [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to see changes to plugin views in real time. ^FIQf5ZoJXIBP

## Editor View

The editor view is a view that shows up inside of an editor pane in vscode.
The Dendron Preview is an example of an `Editor View`.

## IDE Mode

In IDE mode, we run `webpack export` to generate static js and css bundles of all views. We then [[launch the Dendron Plugin|dendron://dendron.docs/pkg.plugin-core.quickstart]] in development mode to see the webview changes integrated with VSCode ^OBOH23affA2J
