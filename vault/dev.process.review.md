## Summary

The Dendron code review process

## Prerequisites

We recommend using the github cli to work on pull requests (not required but helpful). More details on the setup [[here|dendron://dendron.docs/dev.process.review.github-cli]]

## Steps

### Submitting
1. Open up a pull request 
1. Make sure the title of the pull request mirrors the [[Commit Style|dendron://dendron.docs/dev.process.commit#commit-style]]

### Correspondence

A conversation should only be resolved when the comment has been addressed and is reflected in the pull request. 
At that point, the conversation should be resolved by the person that made the pull request.
